- PaaS: Platform as a Service (provide cloud components to certain software )
Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service (Cloud infrastructure services)
Cloud infrastructure services, known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated compute resources. IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services. IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware outright.

- 模型和模式的区别
  - 模型
模型是对客观现实的事物的某些特征与内在联系,所作的一种模拟或抽象
模型是所研究的系统、过程、事物或概念的一种表达形式
一切客观存在的事物及其运动形态统称为实体，模型是对实体的特征及其变化规律的一种表示或者抽象

   - 模式
从字面的意思理解，“模”一种标准，或者一种套路，“式”方式，方法，形式 。两个字连接在一起就可以解释为，一种可以重复使用，具有参考性的方法、知识体系。
